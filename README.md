# ISDS454_Inventory
# Inventory Management System for ISDS 454
# Created using Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Django. The database is SQLlite
# UI is from https://bootswatch.com/
# We chose Python because we heard that it is very versetile and we want to see how it can interact with Javascript, HTML, CSS. With Django we can write logics inside HTML, which creates room for grow and fast development of other features
